# Plates Of Mayhem

## This gamemode is deprecated: do not expect this to work fully (or at all).
A Garry's Mod gamemode where you have to survive on "plates" floating in mid-air. Random things can happen, such as you receiving a gun, or your plate getting smaller.

This gamemode is a work in progress (which means there will be bugs) and I'll be updating this gamemode every once in a while. The only map this gamemode works on is "gm_mars" (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=294212909) .
